# Touch Sensor Example

Welcome to this touch sensor example. More information can be found on my [website](http://www.clobbercreations.co.uk)

For this project we are using a Pico. The Pico is a recent release from the Raspberry Pi Foundation and their expansion into the microcontroller market. The Pico is cost effective and small enough to be used in a wearable tech project. The code used is in MicroPython and I have taken care to comment the code.

## Materials Required

* Fabric
* Pressure-Sensitive Conductive Sheet (Velostat/Linqstat)  
* Woven conductive fabric
* Conductive Thread
* Pico
* Non conductive Thread (normal thread)
